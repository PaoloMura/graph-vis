/*
A graph event is an event that is triggered by the graph, usually in response to user input (e.g. selecting a vertex).
A graph action is an event that the graph listens and responds to (e.g. highlight a given vertex).

Supported Graph Events:
tap_bg (x: int, y: int, graphKey: int)
tap_node (vertex: int, graphKey: int)
tap_edge (source: int, target: int, graphKey: int)
cxttap_bg (x: int, y: int, graphKey: int)
cxttap_node (vertex: int, graphKey: int)
cxttap_edge (source: int, target: int, graphKey: int)
box_end (vertices: [int], edges: [[int, int]], graphKey: int)

Supported Graph Actions:
highlightVertex (vertex: int, highlight: bool, graphKey: int)
highlightEdge (v1: int, v2: int, highlight: bool, graphKey: int)
